IJG JPEG LIBRARY:  FILE LISTCopyright (C) 1994, Thomas G. Lane.This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.Here is a road map to the files in the IJG JPEG distribution.  Thedistribution includes the JPEG library proper, plus two applicationprograms ("cjpeg" and "djpeg") which use the library to convert JPEGfiles to and from some other popular image formats.THE JPEG LIBRARY================Include files:jpeglib.h	JPEG library's exported data and function declarations.jconfig.h	Configuration declarations.  Note: this file is not present		in the distribution; it is generated during installation.jmorecfg.h	Additional configuration declarations; need not be changed		for a standard installation.jerror.h	Declares JPEG library's error and trace message codes.jinclude.h	Central include file used by library's .c files.jpegint.h	JPEG library's internal data structures.jdct.h		Private declarations for forward & reverse DCT subsystems.jmemsys.h	Private declarations for memory management subsystem.jversion.h	Version information.Applications using the library should include jpeglib.h (which in turnincludes jconfig.h and jmorecfg.h).  Optionally, jerror.h may be includedif the application needs to reference individual JPEG error codes.  Theother include files are intended for internal use and would not normallybe included by an application program.  (cjpeg/djpeg do use jinclude.h,since its function is to improve portability of the whole IJG distribution.Most other applications will directly include the system include files theywant, and hence won't need jinclude.h.)C source code files:These files contain most of the functions intended to be called directly byan application program:jcapi.c		Application program interface routines for compression.jdapi.c		Application program interface routines for decompression.jcomapi.c	Application program interface routines common to compression		and decompression.jcparam.c	Compression parameter setting helper routines.Compression side of the library:jcmaster.c	Master control: determines which other modules to use.jcmainct.c	Main buffer controller (preprocessor => JPEG compressor).jcprepct.c	Preprocessor buffer controller.jccoefct.c	Buffer controller for DCT coefficient buffer.jccolor.c	Color space conversion.jcsample.c	Downsampling.jcdctmgr.c	DCT manager (DCT implementation selection & control).jfdctllm.c	Forward DCT using LL&M algorithm (very high quality).jchuff.c	Huffman entropy coding.jcmarker.c	JPEG marker writing.jdatadst.c	Data destination manager for stdio output.Decompression side of the library:jdmaster.c	Master control: determines which other modules to use.jdmainct.c	Main buffer controller (JPEG decompressor => postprocessor).jdcoefct.c	Buffer controller for DCT coefficient buffer.jdpostct.c	Postprocessor buffer controller.jdmarker.c	JPEG marker reading.jdhuff.c	Huffman entropy decoding.jddctmgr.c	IDCT manager (IDCT implementation selection & control).jidctllm.c	Inverse DCT using LL&M algorithm (very high quality).jidctred.c	Inverse DCTs with reduced-size outputs.jdsample.c	Upsampling.jdcolor.c	Color space conversion.jquant1.c	One-pass color quantization using a fixed-spacing colormap.jquant2.c	Two-pass color quantization using a custom-generated colormap.		Also handles one-pass quantization to an externally given map.jdatasrc.c	Data source manager for stdio input.Support files for both compression and decompression:jerror.c	Standard error handling routines (application replaceable).jmemmgr.c	System-independent (more or less) memory management code.jutils.c	Miscellaneous utility routines.jmemmgr.c relies on a system-dependent memory management module.  The IJGdistribution includes the following implementations of the system-dependentmodule:jmemnobs.c	"No backing store": assumes adequate virtual memory exists.jmemansi.c	Makes temporary files with ANSI-standard routine tmpfile().jmemname.c	Makes temporary files with program-generated file names.jmemdos.c	Custom implementation for MS-DOS: knows about extended and		expanded memory as well as temporary files.Exactly one of the system-dependent modules should be configured into aninstalled JPEG library (see install.doc for hints about which one to use).On unusual systems you may find it worthwhile to make a specialsystem-dependent memory manager.Non-C source code files:jmemdosa.asm	80x86 assembly code support for jmemdos.c; used only in		MS-DOS-specific configurations of the JPEG library.CJPEG/DJPEG===========Include files:cdjpeg.h	Declarations shared by cjpeg/djpeg modules.cderror.h	Additional error and trace message codes for cjpeg/djpeg.C source code files:cjpeg.c		Main program for cjpeg.djpeg.c		Main program for djpeg.Image file reader modules for cjpeg:rdgif.c		GIF file input.rdppm.c		PPM/PGM file input.rdtarga.c	Targa file input.Image file writer modules for djpeg:wrgif.c		GIF file output.wrppm.c		PPM/PGM file output.wrtarga.c	Targa file output.ADDITIONAL FILES================Documentation (see README for a guide to the documentation files):README		Master documentation file.*.doc		Other documentation files.*.1		Documentation in Unix man page format.change.log	Version-to-version change highlights.example.c	Sample code for calling JPEG library.Configuration/installation files and programs (see install.doc for more info):configure	Unix shell script to perform automatic configuration.ckconfig.c	Program to generate jconfig.h on non-Unix systems.jconfig.doc	Template for making jconfig.h by hand.makefile.*	Sample makefiles for particular systems.jconfig.*	Sample jconfig.h for particular systems.ansi2knr.c	De-ANSIfier for pre-ANSI C compilers (courtesy of		L. Peter Deutsch and Aladdin Enterprises).Test files (see install.doc for test procedure):test*.*		Source and comparison files for confidence test.		These are binary image files, NOT text files.
